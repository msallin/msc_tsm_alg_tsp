# TSP Playground

## Introduction

This code provides a framework for implementing algorithms, which aim to solve the travelling salesman problem.
It is supposed to be used in the second part of the module TSM_Alg (MSc in Engineering degree course), teached by Mark Cieliebak.

## Contributors

Mark Cieliebak wrote the Java version.
The inital port was created from Riedi Linus (linriedi@hotmail.com).
My contribution was to migrate it from .NET Core 1.0 Preview, to .NET Core 3.1 and apply some minor code cleanups and making it self contained.
